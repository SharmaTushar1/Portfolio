# First blog (Test Blog)

Hi! I'm Tushar Sharma. This is copy of my first blog!! Well, technically it is my 0th blog coz I'll just be posting this one for testing purpose as currently I'm working on my portfolio which I was postponing for so long coz I was being lazy. But now I'll get it done ig.

- Listening to spotify while working on this. NCS song. I love NCS. Listening to them since 2015. Song is Hollah! by Disfigure.
- It's 03:49 pm rn.
- Another random text to fill space and check!!!
This much looks enough have a great day if anyone is reading this in future. Hopefully I'll have a decent job by then.
